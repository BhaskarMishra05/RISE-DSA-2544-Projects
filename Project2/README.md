# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Educational institutions often lack early warning systems to identify students at risk of failing or dropping out. Timely insights into performance metrics are essential for proactive academic interventions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a data-driven dashboard that analyzes student-related parameters to:
- Highlight academic performance trends
- Identify at-risk students
- Support timely and personalized interventions

---

| `Access_to_Resources` | Availability of learning resources |
| `Extracurricular_Activities` | Participation in extracurriculars |
| `Sleep_Hours` | Average sleep hours per day |
| `Previous_Scores` | Last academic score |
| `Motivation_Level` | Self-reported motivation |
| `Internet_Access` | Yes/No |
| `Tutoring_Sessions` | No. of tutoring sessions attended |
| `Family_Income` | Income category |
| `Teacher_Quality` | Rated by student feedback |
| `School_Type` | Government/Private |
| `Peer_Influence` | Peer pressure or support |
| `Physical_Activity` | Hours per week |
| `Learning_Disabilities` | Yes/No |
| `Parental_Education_Level` | Education background of parents |
| `Distance_from_Home` | Distance to school |
| `Gender` | Male/Female |

## ðŸ§ª Key Tasks Performed

- Handled missing values using mode imputation
- Performed descriptive statistics on key features
- Correlation analysis between numeric features
- Classified students into `Top`, `Average`, and `Struggling`
- Explored impacts of attendance, motivation, internet access, and sleep
- Created interactive and static visualizations

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- ðŸ“Œ **Heatmap** of correlations between performance indicators  
- ðŸ“Œ **Scatter Plot** of attendance vs exam score  
- ðŸ“Œ **Box Plot** of performance vs motivational factors  
- ðŸ“Œ **Violin & Bar Plots** for categorical feature impacts  
- ðŸ“Œ **Count Plot** for performance-level distribution

## âœ… Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Plotly Express**

---

## ðŸš€ Results & Outcome

- Identified top and at-risk students using performance segmentation  
- Revealed strong positive correlation between study hours, tutoring, and exam scores  
- Showed that low attendance and low motivation significantly correlate with poor performance  
- Created actionable dashboards for educators
