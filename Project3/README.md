# üõçÔ∏è Project 3: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

## üìå Problem Statement

Businesses need to categorize customers based on behaviors and demographics to enable better targeting, increase conversion, and improve customer satisfaction. Without segmentation, marketing efforts become generic and inefficient.

---

## üéØ Objective

Apply **unsupervised machine learning** (K-Means) to:
- Group similar customers into meaningful clusters
- Enable data-driven personalization in marketing strategies
- Discover hidden patterns in customer behavior

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

| Column Name        | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `ID`               | Unique Customer ID                         |
| `Gender`           | Male/Female                                |
| `Ever_Married`     | Marital status                             |
| `Age`              | Age of customer                            |
| `Graduated`        | Whether the customer graduated             |
| `Profession`       | Profession of the customer                 |
| `Work_Experience`  | Years of experience                        |
| `Spending_Score`   | Customer spending behavior                 |
| `Family_Size`      | Number of family members                   |
| `Var_1`            | Unknown feature (categorical)              |
| `Segmentation`     | Existing label (used only for reference)   |

## üß™ Workflow

1. Merged `Train.csv` and `Test.csv` for uniform preprocessing
2. Imputed missing values using median/mode
3. Performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables
4. Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`
5. Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Scores** to select optimal `k`
6. Applied **K-Means clustering**
7. Reduced dimensions via **PCA** for 2D and 3D plotting
8. Visualized clusters and extracted cluster-wise insights
9. Saved plots in the `plots/` directory

## üìà K Selection: Silhouette Scores

| K | Silhouette Score |
|---|------------------|
| 2 | **0.2064** ‚úÖ _(Best)_
| 3 | 0.1582           |
| 4 | 0.1392           |
| 5 | 0.1354           |
| 6 | 0.1356           |
| 7 | 0.1391           |
| 8 | 0.1319           |
| 9 | 0.1329           |

‚û°Ô∏è **K=2 gives the highest silhouette score**, suggesting two clearly distinguishable customer segments.

## üîç Cluster Summary (K=4 View for Reference)

| Cluster | Avg Age | Avg Work Exp | Avg Family Size | Interpretation                       |
|---------|---------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0       | 51.28   | 2.17         | 3.43             | Middle-aged families, moderate work  |
| 1       | 31.70   | 2.86         | 3.01             | Young professionals, small families |
| 2       | 47.94   | 2.37         | 2.76             | Mature workers, medium households   |
| 3       | 75.46   | 1.19         | 1.98             | Seniors, low work experience         |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Final clustering used **K=2**, as per silhouette results. K=4 was also analyzed for insight depth.
